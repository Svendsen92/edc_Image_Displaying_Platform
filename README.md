# edc_Image_Displaying

### *Objective*
The objective of this repository is to create a small formfactor device for displaying house listings using existing monitors. The listing images are retrived from the realtors website and shown in order on the monitor, and the images are updated every set amount of time. This means that the device shows the listings on the website, so no additional work is required to show them on the monitor that the device is connected to.

#### Hardware
A Raspberry Pi is used as the device to be connected to the given monitor via an HDMI cable. The only configuration needed is to connect it to the internet, and specify the URL to the listings page of the realtors website.

### *How to get it running*
This application was build to run on linux operating system such as Ubuntu and Raspian(Raspberry Pi).

If the Raspberry Pi is used these installation steps must be followed: [installing_external_lib_for_raspberry_jessie.txt]installing_external_lib_for_raspberry_jessie.txt
If the Raspberry Pi is used these installation steps must be followed: [installing_external_libs_for_ubuntu16-04.txt]installing_external_libs_for_ubuntu16-04.txt

Now the application should be able to running.
